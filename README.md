# Eat-Da-Burger!

This app allows you to add a burger to a list.  The burger can then be devoured and, once devoured, can be deleted.  The list is updated on the MySQL database and allows the user to interact directly with the app.  This app utilizes both front-end and back-end, making it a full stack web application.

## Getting Started

Install required npm packages: npm install
Run the app on your command line: node server.js
